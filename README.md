## Project Origin

This project was developed to participate in an internal hackathon within the Polichain group. It was crafted using a template for Web3 hackathons, which was also created by the Polichain team. You can find the template at https://github.com/polichain/web3-dapp-template.

## Getting Started
Each part has its own README.md file. Consult these for guidance on code execution and deeper insights into each component.

>  The instructions for this repo will assume that you have basic programs already installed, like Node.js, Git, an IDE, MetaMask (or any wallet), etc.
